<h4>
	Having worked in this field since a very young age, I developed an early love for travelling and everything that has something to do with tourism. From an early stage of my life I was especially interested in exploring my own country, Pakistan, which offers an amazing variety of superb holiday destinations. During my extensive travels over the years in Pakistan, I believed I had visited every corner of this country, but to my surprise, on each new journey I discovered a part of my country that I had never experienced before.<br><br>

<center>Throughout the years I have strived to attain several goals:</center><br>

To emphasize the importance of “domestic travelers” and to increase awareness amongst my fellow Pakistanis about the beauty of their own country. To invite and serve people from all over the world who have developed a love for Pakistan. Until today many customers return, and many continue to keep in touch with us, recalling the “Adventure Pakistan” that they had had the chance to experience. To encourage my countrymen to travel abroad and experience new cultures and meet new people in order to expand the horizons of their mind as well as their knowledge. And last but not least, to encourage our youth to participate in school trips in order to change attitudes and raise aspirations through new activities and experiences. Rising to new challenges and living alongside their peers helps pupils become more adaptable and confident; aspects which are critical to so many areas of their development.<br><br>

All these travelers help foster an understanding between people, providing a cultural exchange between both hosts and guests and increasing the chances to develop mutual sympathy and understanding towards our country while at the same time reducing their prejudices; an aspect much needed in these times.<br><br>


I hope to see tourism in Pakistan increase in the future, bringing with it all its benefits and capacity to increase interaction and understanding between different people. There is much to be done and I will continue pursuing my life passion in the hope that one day everyone gets the opportunity to experience what traveling could mean for them.<br>
